I want to unchain the power of data that are trapped in siloed systems and disciplines to improve human health. I am a computational scientist by training with extensive experience in model, method and system development for large clinical data analysis and research 
infrastructure development with high performance computing system. My motivation to work in healthcare arises from a deep desire to contribute in the human well being, live life happily and abundantly. I want to use technology, extremely large data sources, and new methods to 
complement the clinical expertise for the future of medicine.

I am a Research Scientist at the Regenstrief Center for Healthcare Engineering (RCHE) located at Purdue University, Indiana. I joined RCHE as an Assistant Research Scientist after my Ph.D. in 2015. I did my Ph.D. in Computational Sciences from Marquette University, Milwaukee, Wisconsin under the supervision of Dr. Stephen Merrill and 
Dr. Sheikh Iqbal Ahamed. My Ph.D. research focused on mathematical model development using eigenvalue based methods such as eigenface for facial image classification, mixing rate or second largest eigenvalue based algorithm for hemorrhage detection from blood pressure, among others. 
During my Ph.D., I worked at the US Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) under the supervision of Dr. David Strauss on applications of the mathematical models with clinical data and high performance computing system. Before my Ph.D., I worked as a Junior Research Fellow at the Human Computer
Interaction Lab with Professor Shendong Zhao at the National University of Singapore (NUS). I also worked as a Software Engineer at the Structured Data Systems Ltd. (SDSL). I have an undergraduate degree in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET).

At Regenstrief, I have built the research infrastructure for data analysis from the ground up, established partnership with the Laboratory for Computational Physiology at the MIT led by Roger Mark, and industry partnership for state of the art distributed database technology
with Paradigm4, founded by Turing Award recipient MIT Computer Scientist Mike Stonebroker. I am leading a new line of research at RCHE for explainable Artificial Intelligence (AI) in health sciences, and actively collaborating with Elias Bareinboim, Professor of Computer 
Science at Columbia University. The goal is to introduce new methods of explainable AI in clinical research. I secured a grant of $100k dollar to develop a cloud computing environment with HIPAA compliant servers for EHR and physiological data for thousands of patients from Beth Israel Deaconess Hospital as well as a 69M patients cohort. I also received a a $300k data science initiative grant from Purdue for explainable AI for clinical understanding and translation in healthcare.  At the same time, I have 
published many of these works in top journals and conferences. I have also successfully submitted multiple NSF and DOD grant proposals.
