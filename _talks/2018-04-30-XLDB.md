Big data has brought much promise for discovery of treatment and therapies, drug safety, and care delivery process by identifying which treatment would work best for which 
patients. NIH has recently taken the initiative, 'All of Us', to collect one million or more patients' data (electronic health records (EHR), imaging, genomics, environmental 
data, etc.) over the next few years. Intensive care unit represents a unique data source in this context, with carefully captured detailed high volume data from different 
systems such as EHR, electrocardiogram, blood pressure, infusion pumps, and photoplethysmogram, among other data. However, the mere availability of data does not translate 
into knowledge or improved outcome. Questions remain on what data is needed, how to integrate these high volume data with high throughput infrastructure for near real time 
decision making by the clinicians. In this talk, we present our works in integrating this heterogeneous high-volume data with state of the art technologies for retrospective 
analysis and near real time decision making with the Medical Information Mart from Intensive Care Unit (MIMIC III) database, a nationally recognized data set.
