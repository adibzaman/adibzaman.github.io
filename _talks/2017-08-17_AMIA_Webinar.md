Despite the promise of big data, little evidence has been generated for clinical practice with data driven systems. A new model for collaborative access, exploration, and analyses of integrated clinical data will be presented with a standard database, Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care - III (MIMIC III), for translational clinical research. The proposed model addresses the significant disconnect between data collection at the point of care and translational clinical research. It addresses problems of data integration, pre-processing, normalization, analyses (along with associated compute back-end), and visualization. The pre-packaged analyses toolkit is easily extensible, and allows for multi-language support. The platform can be easily federated, mirrored at other locations, and supports a RESTful API for service composition and scaling.
