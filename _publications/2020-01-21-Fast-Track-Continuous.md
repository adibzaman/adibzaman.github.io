Background: Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) or flutter is prevalent among patients with cryptogenic stroke. The goal 
of this study was to investigate the feasibility of incorporating a fast-track, long term continuous heart monitoring (LTCM) 
program within a stroke clinic.

Method: We designed and implemented a fast-track LTCM program in our stroke clinics. The instrument that we used for the 
study was the ZioXT® device from IRhythm™ Technologies. To implement the program, all clinic support staff received training 
on the skin preparation and proper placement of the device. We prospectively followed every patient who had a request from 
one of our inpatient or outpatient stroke or neurology providers to receive LTCM. We recorded patients' demographics, the 
LTCM indication, as well as related quality measures including same-visit placement, wearing time, analyzable time, LTCM 
application to the preliminary finding time, as well as patients' out of pocket cost.
