Identifying causal relationships for a treatment intervention is a fundamental problem in health sciences. Randomized 
controlled trials (RCTs) are considered the gold standard for identifying causal relationships. However, 
recent advancements in the theory of causal inference based on the foundations of structural causal models 
(SCMs) have allowed the identification of causal relationships from observational data, under certain 
assumptions. Survival analysis provides standard measures, such as the hazard ratio, to quantify the effects
of an intervention. While hazard ratios are widely used in clinical and epidemiological studies for RCTs, a 
principled approach does not exist to compute hazard ratios for observational studies with SCMs. In this \
work, we review existing approaches to compute hazard ratios as well as their causal interpretation, if it 
exists. We also propose a novel approach to compute hazard ratios from observational studies using backdoor 
adjustment through SCMs and do-calculus. Finally, we evaluate the approach using experimental data for 
Ewing's sarcoma.
