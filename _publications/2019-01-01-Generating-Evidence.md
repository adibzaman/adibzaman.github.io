Objectives: The aim of this research was to develop data-driven models using electronic health records (EHRs) to conduct 
clinical studies for predicting clinical outcomes through probabilistic analysis that considers temporal aspects of clinical 
data. We assess the efficacy of antibiotics treatment and the optimal time of initiation for in-hospitalized diagnosed with 
acute exacerbation of COPD (AECOPD) as an application to probabilistic modeling. Materials and Methods: We developed a 
semi-automatic Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) modeling and simulation approach that encodes clinical conditions as 
computable definitions of health states and exact time duration as input for parameter estimations using raw EHR data. 
We applied the MCMC approach to the MIMIC-III clinical database, where ICD-9 diagnosis codes (491.21, 491.22, and 494.1) 
were used to identify data for 697 AECOPD patients of which 25.9% were administered antibiotics. Results: The average time 
to antibiotic administration was 27 hours, and 32% of patients were administered vancomycin as the initial antibiotic. The 
model simulations showed a 50% decrease in mortality rate as the number of patients administered antibiotics increased. 
There was an estimated 5.5% mortality rate when antibiotics were initially administrated after 48 hours vs 1.8% when 
antibiotics were initially administrated between 24 and 48 hours. Discussion: Our findings suggest that there may be a 
mortality benefit in initiation of antibiotics early in patient with severe respiratory failure in settings of COPD 
exacerbations warranting an ICU admission. Conclusion: Probabilistic modeling and simulation methods that considers temporal 
aspects of raw clinical patient data can be used to adequately generate evidence for clinical guidelines.
