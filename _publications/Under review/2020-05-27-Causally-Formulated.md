Identifying causal relationships for a treatment intervention is a fundamental problem in health sciences, computer 
science, and statistics research. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are considered the gold standard for identifying 
causal relationships. However, recent advancements in the theory of causal inference based on the foundations of a 
structural causal model (SCM) have allowed the identification of causal relationships from observational data. Survival 
analysis provides the standard tools, such as the hazard ratio, to quantify the effects of an intervention over time. 
While hazard ratios are widely used in clinical and epidemiological studies for RCTs, a principled approach does not 
exist to compute hazard ratio for observational studies using a structural causal model. In this work, we review existing 
approaches to compute hazard ratios as well as their causal interpretation, if there is any. We also propose a novel 
approach to compute hazard ratios from observational studies using backdoor adjustment through SCMs and do-calculus. 
We discuss the benefit of explaining the causal relationship between treatment and outcome. Finally, we compare and 
evaluate the approach with experiments and an application dataset.
