The proliferation of sensor technologies and advancements in data collection methods have enabled the accumulation of 
very large amounts of data. Increasingly, these datasets are considered for scientific research. However, the design of 
the system architecture to achieve high performance in terms of parallelization, query processing time, aggregation of 
heterogeneous data type (e.g., time series, images, structured data, among others), and, difficulty in reproducing 
scientific research remains a major challenge. This is specifically true for health sciences research, where the systems 
must be i) easy to use with the flexibility to manipulate data at the most granular level, ii) agnostic of programming 
language kernel, iii) scalable, and iv) compliant with the HIPAA privacy law. In this paper, we review the existing 
literature for such big data systems for scientific research in health sciences and identify the gaps of the current 
system landscape. We propose a novel architecture for software-hardware-data ecosystem using open source technologies 
such as Apache Hadoop, Kubernetes and JupyterHub in a distributed environment. We also evaluate the system using a large 
clinical data set of 69M patients.
