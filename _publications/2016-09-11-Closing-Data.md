We describe a new model for collaborative access, exploration, and analyses of the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care - III (MIMIC III) 
database for translational clinical research. The proposed model addresses the significant disconnect between data collection at 
the point of care and translational clinical research. It addresses problems of data integration, preprocessing, normalization, 
analyses (along with associated compute back-end), and visualization. The proposed platform is general, and can be easily adapted 
to other databases. The pre-packaged analyses toolkit is easily extensible, and allows for multi-language support. The platform can 
be easily federated, mirrored at other locations, and supports a RESTful API for service composition and scaling.
